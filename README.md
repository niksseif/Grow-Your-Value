# Grow Your Value!

**Grow Your Value** is a application that gives users time and space to reflect on their values and see those values grow. Inspired by [research](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/nudging-ahead/201802/using-self-affirmation-support-struggling-students) that indicates that struggling students can gain confidence and handle threats (like high-stakes assessments) more comfortablly by practicing a value affirmation exercise, **Grow Your Value** is here to help you remember what is important to you, so you can meet your challenges head on!

## Tech Stack

### Front End

- React :)

## Goals

- Created as part of a Turing Frontend Instructor Hackathon, our first priority was to **play**
- Work with fellow team members on an technical project
- Re-familiarize ourselves with a beginners mindset
- Step into the shoes of our students

## Planning

To see the process, check out the project board **[here](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOCvpgrk=/)**

## Future Iterations
- Increase number of microinteractions/ audio cues to create a calming, reflective space
- Give the user options for how they choose to reflect on their values (journaling, drawing, sharing links to relavant articles)
